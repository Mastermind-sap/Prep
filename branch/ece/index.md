      title: SEM 1
      details: What actually happens inside those tiny chips? We don’t fully know yet, but it probably involves a lot of voltage.

      title: SEM 2
      details: We finally made an LED blink! Not sure how… but it blinked, and that’s enough science for today.

    - icon: 💻
      title: SEM 3
      details: Circuits make sense, until one resistor ruins the whole thing. Still figuring out what ‘ground’ actually means.

      title: SEM 4
      details: Signals and Systems sounded peaceful, turns out it’s just math with trust issues.

    - icon: 🌐
      title: SEM 5
      details: Communication theory says noise is bad, but our lab’s full of it anyway. Trying to make sense of amplitude and attendance.

      title: SEM 6
      details: Microprocessors are fun, until the circuit refuses to run. We swear we connected the pins right... probably.

    - icon: ⚡
      title: SEM 7
      details: We can finally design circuits… that almost work. Debugging both hardware and hope.

    - icon: 📊
      title: SEM 8
      details: From signals to soldering, we learned everything, except how to fix the lab kit. Ready to connect to the real world.
