    - icon: 🎯
      title: SEM 1
      details: What are we actually measuring? No clue yet, but the multimeter says it’s working, so we’ll take it as a win.

    - icon: 🏗️
      title: SEM 2
      details: We connected sensors and wires, and somehow things started blinking. Still not sure if that’s a success or a short circuit.

    - icon: 💻
      title: SEM 3
      details: Signals make sense on paper -> until the oscilloscope says otherwise.

    - icon: 🗄️
      title: SEM 4
      details: Instrumentation sounds fancy until we realize we’re just measuring errors in measurements.

    - icon: 🌐
      title: SEM 5
      details: Control Systems teach us how to maintain stability sadly, not in real life.

      title: SEM 6
      details: We’re learning automation, but somehow can’t automate our assignments.

    - icon: ⚡
      title: SEM 7
      details: Circuits, sensors, and simulations -> we’re just trying to keep the smoke inside the components.

    - icon: 📊
      title: SEM 8
      details: After years of calibrating instruments and chaos, we’ve finally learned that precision is overrated, as long as it works.
