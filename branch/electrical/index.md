    tagline: Because resistance is futile. Circuits, machines, and voltage-induced trauma await.

features:
    - icon: 🎯
      title: SEM 1
      details: What really makes the current flow? We’re not totally sure yet, but we’ve seen enough sparks to know we’re getting closer.

    - icon: 🏗️
      title: SEM 2
      details: We connected some wires, flipped a switch, and nothing happened. Still trying to figure out where the power went.

    - icon: 💻
      title: SEM 3
      details: Ohm’s Law makes sense, until the readings don’t. We’re learning that resistance applies to both current and students.

    - icon: 🗄️
      title: SEM 4
      details: Machines are supposed to rotate smoothly, but ours just screamed. Still pretending we understand torque.

    - icon: 🌐
      title: SEM 5
      details: Power Systems sound powerful, until you realize it’s mostly endless line diagrams and short circuits.

    - icon: ☕
      title: SEM 6
      details: Control Systems teach stability(ironic), since we have none. Still figuring out how feedback actually works.

    - icon: ⚡
      title: SEM 7
      details: Protection Systems keep machines safe -> now if only they could protect our grades too.

    - icon: 📊
      title: SEM 8
      details: After years of circuits, machines, and math, we finally know how power flows, and it feels electric.
