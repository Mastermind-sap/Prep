  - icon: 🎯
    title: SEM 1
    details: What really makes things move? We’re not totally sure yet, but it probably involves gears, grease, and a lot of guessing.

    title: SEM 2
    details: We learned about thermodynamics, but somehow we’re still freezing in class. Heat transfer remains a mystery, both in theory and in the lab.

    title: SEM 3
    details: Strength of Materials taught us how things bend, break, and fail -> just like us during exams.

  - icon: 🗄️
    title: SEM 4
    details: Fluid Mechanics sounded cool until the equations started to flow endlessly. Still trying to figure out why everything leaks.

  - icon: 🌐
    title: SEM 5
    details: Theory of Machines? We thought it’d be about cars, not endless linkages and diagrams that move in ways we can’t imagine.

  - icon: ☕
    title: SEM 6
    details: Manufacturing labs smell like oil, noise, and confusion. We’re still not sure what the CNC machine is actually doing.

  - icon: ⚡
    title: SEM 7
    details: Design projects everywhere, deadlines closing in, and the only thing we’ve successfully assembled is stress.

  - icon: 📊
    title: SEM 8
    details: After years of bolts, bearings, and burnout, we’ve finally learned how things work and how to fix them when they don’t.
