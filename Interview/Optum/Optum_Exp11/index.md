## 💡 Advice for Others  

🧩 **Master at least two things.**  
If you’re just starting out, **Web Development + Machine Learning** is the safest and most versatile combination.

⚙️ **Never stop your DSA grind.**  
But be smart about it — understand what level of DSA questions a company typically asks, and prepare accordingly instead of trying to cover everything.
