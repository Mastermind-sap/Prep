## 🗣️ Round 1 – HR Interview  

The first round was a **standard HR discussion** focused on behavioral and psychological understanding.  
The interviewer mainly tried to gauge **how I think, react, and communicate** in general situations.  

Some of the questions asked included:  
- “What skills did you learn in college that can help you in the corporate world (other than technical skills)?”  
- “How do you usually handle disagreements in a team?”  
- “What motivates you to do your best work?”  

The tone of the round was friendly and conversational, with an emphasis on **personality, mindset, and interpersonal skills** rather than technical depth.

## ⚙️ Round 2 – Technical Interview (Duration: ~1 hour 15 minutes)  

This round turned out to be **a mix of HR and technical discussions**.  
The interviewer was an **Associate Director**, and surprisingly, the first **one hour** felt more like a deep personality and mindset conversation.  

He asked questions such as:  
- “What philosophy do you believe in your life?”  
- “How do you handle failure or criticism?”  
- “What defines success for you?”  

The discussion was thought-provoking and tested my **emotional intelligence**, **consistency**, and **self-awareness** rather than just technical skill.  

In the last part of the interview, I was asked:  
- One **DSA problem**, which was based on arrays (medium-level).

Finally, the interviewer asked me about my **Machine Learning project**, where I had **replicated a neural network library** — quite an advanced topic.  
We discussed the project architecture, activation functions, and what challenges I faced during implementation.

## 💡 Advice for Others  

✨ **Be yourself — not rehearsed.**  
Many interviews at this level are designed to test **your authenticity**, not your ability to give perfect answers.  

🧩 **Prepare your resume like a story.**  
Be ready to talk about every project or achievement with passion and clarity, especially if it’s something complex like ML or AI.  

💬 **Don’t fear unexpected questions.**  
Sometimes, interviewers test how you **think under uncertainty** rather than what you already know. Take a pause, breathe, and answer calmly.
