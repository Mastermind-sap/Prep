# 💼 Interview Experience – Optum TDP Intern

**Type:** On-Campus Opportunity  
**Role:** Technology Development Program (Intern)  
**Total Rounds:** 2 (HR + Technical)

---

## 🗣️ Round 1 – HR Interview (Duration: 8–10 minutes)

The first round was a short and friendly **HR interview**.  
The questions were focused on **situational and behavioral** topics that tested communication, clarity, and emotional intelligence.  

Some of the questions asked were:  
- “Tell me a time when you had to explain a very complex topic to your friends or someone, and how did they respond?”  
- “Tell me a time when you challenged yourself to do something, and what was its result?”  

The key in this round was **storytelling** — how you present yourself and the flow of your answers matters more than what you actually did.  
The interviewer seemed interested in understanding **your thought process and personality**.  

💡 **Tip:** Be expressive and detailed when sharing your story, small details make your answers feel real and help you connect with the interviewer.

## ⚙️ Round 2 – Technical Interview (Duration: 40 minutes)

The technical round was **resume-centric** and focused mainly on **projects** rather than coding.  

I wasn’t asked any DSA problems or deep algorithmic questions.  
Instead, the interviewer asked me to explain:  
- The **projects** mentioned on my resume their purpose, tech stack, and my specific contributions.  
- A few **questions about Python libraries** I had used.  
- Some **basic frontend concepts** and how I applied them in my work.  

The interviewer seemed more interested in my **clarity, understanding, and approach** rather than syntax or definitions.

## 💡 Advice for Others  

🧩 **Be clear, confident, and human.**  
Interviews aren’t only about knowing everything — they’re about showing how you think and communicate.  

🎯 **Own your resume.**  
If you’ve mentioned something, be ready to talk about it in depth. Every word on it can become a question.  

💬 **Be a storyteller, not a robot.**  
The more real and expressive you are, the more likely you’ll stand out. Don’t memorize HR answers — personalize them.  

⚙️ **Revise your basics.**  
Brush up on Python libraries, frontend fundamentals, and tools you’ve worked with — even light revision helps you stay confident.
