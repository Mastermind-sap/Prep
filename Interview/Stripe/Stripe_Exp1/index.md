# 💼 Interview Experience – Stripe Software Engineering Intern

**Type:** Off-Campus Opportunity  
**Role:** Software Engineering Intern  
**Duration:** 6 Months  
**Total Rounds:** 4 (OA + Programming Exercise 1 + Programming Exercise 2 + API Integration)

---

## 🧪 Round 1 – Online Assessment (OA)

The first round was an **Online Assessment (OA)** consisting of **1 coding question** with a duration of **60 minutes**.

### 🔍 Problem Overview
- The entire input was provided in **string format**
- The actual inputs had to be **extracted using regular expressions**
- Once parsing was done correctly, the logic was manageable

🧠 *Tip:* This round focused more on **string manipulation and input handling** rather than algorithmic difficulty.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared OA

---

## ⚠️ Programming Language Selection (Important Note)

After clearing the OA, the interviewer clearly mentioned that:
- **C++ can be a disadvantage**, as many required libraries are unavailable
- **Python, Java, or JavaScript** are preferred languages at Stripe

Despite this, I opted for **C++** due to limited proficiency in other languages.

📌 **Advice:**  
If you are comfortable with **Python / Java / JavaScript**, prefer those languages.

## 📘 Interview Format Note

📌 All subsequent rounds were **open-book**:
- Internet access allowed
- Official documentation allowed
- ❌ **LLM tools were strictly prohibited** (even Gemini suggestions during Google search 🥲)

---

## 🧩 Round 2 – Programming Exercise 1

This round involved a **simple coding problem**.

### 🔍 Focus Areas
- Writing **clean and readable code**
- Proper **naming conventions**
- Code that is **easy to understand and modify**
- Maintainability over clever tricks

🧠 Stripe values **production-quality code**.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 2

---

## 🧩 Round 3 – Programming Exercise 2

This round was similar to the previous one.

### 🔍 Focus Areas
- Code structure and clarity
- Logical correctness
- Maintainability and readability

🧠 Think like you're writing **real-world engineering code**, not competitive programming solutions.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 3

## 🌐 Round 4 – API Integration Round

This was the **most challenging round**.

### 🔧 Task Description
- Cloned a **private GitHub repository** provided by Stripe
- Fixed multiple **issues in the existing codebase**
- Worked with **API integration**

### ❌ What Went Wrong
- Limited experience with:
  - API integration
  - HTTP requests
  - API handling in **C++**

Even though documentation was allowed, lack of hands-on experience caused difficulties.

### 📚 Recommended Preparation
If using C++:
- `libcurl` for HTTP requests  
- `ifstream` / `ofstream` for file handling  
- JSON parsing libraries  
- REST API fundamentals

References:
- [libcurl Documentation](https://curl.se/libcurl/)
- [REST API Introduction – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/)
- [JSON Parsing in C++ – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-parsing-in-c/)

❌ **Outcome:** Rejected in this round

---

## 🏁 Final Result

❌ **Not Selected**

---

## 🌟 Overall Experience

The interview process was **well-structured and enjoyable**.  
Stripe strongly emphasizes **clean code, maintainability, and real-world engineering practices**.

Although the final result was **disappointing 🥲**, the experience was highly insightful.

---

## 💡 Advice for Others

- Prefer **Python / Java / JavaScript** if possible  
- Focus on **clean, readable, maintainable code**
- Learn **API basics** before the interview
- Open-book interviews still require **hands-on experience**
